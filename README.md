# AWS-Lambda-Cost-Optimization-with-Terraform

[![Build](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

---
## Description
This is a terraform script for cost optimization using lambda. So, this script can set up a cron(schedule) to start and stop ec2 servers. So, if we need to work a server like an office time like 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM then we can save our time and effort to do this thing manually.

----
## Feature
- We can save billing money  
- Automated with CloudWatch
- EC2 instance with root password (if you need key based please enable that after creation)

----
## Architecture
![](lambda_code/screenshots/flow_architecture.jpg)

----
## Services Created

- EC2
- Security Group
- IAM Role (Custom Inline Policies for lambda)
- Lambda Functions
- Cloudwatch Event Rule Trigger

----
## Pre-Requests
- Terraform
- Git

#### Terraform Installation
[Terraform Installation from official](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)

_Terrafom Installation from my script:_
```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com//Terraform_installation/main/terraform.sh | bash
```

#### Pre-Requests (for RedHat-based-Linux)
```
yum install -y git
```

#### Pre-Requests (for Debian-based-Linux)
````
apt install -y git
````

#### Pre-Requests (for Termux-based-Linux)
````
pkg upgrade
pkg install git
````

---
## How to Get
```
git clone https://github.com//AWS-Lambda-Cost-Optimization-with-Terraform.git
cd AWS-Lambda-Cost-Optimization-with-Terraform.git
```

----
## How to execute
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

----
## Output be like
```
 terraform apply -auto-approve

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

## Conclusion
Q: I would like to start and stop an EC2 instance automatically and it's saving cost and time. Also, please create an instance with my wish. So, is it possible?

A: Yeah sure, we can do this with lambda and cloudwatch and you can create an ec2 instance with your required values as you wish. Also, those values can only change through in `terraform.tfvars` so, after it will be automated on rest of time.
